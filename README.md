# 🧠 Deep-Learning-Projects

A playground for **end-to-end deep learning projects** – from data to deployment.

## 📂 Project Index

- `projects/mnist-classifier/`  
  Simple CNN baseline, experiment logging, accuracy tracking.

- `projects/sentiment-analysis/`  
  Text classification using RNN / LSTM / simple Transformer.

- `projects/image-captioning/` *(planned)*  
  Vision + language model for captioning images.

## 🛠 Common Utilities

- `common/training_utils.py` – training loop, metrics, checkpointing  
- `common/config_example.yaml` – example config format for experiments
